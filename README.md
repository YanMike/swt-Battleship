# swt-Battleship

Purpose of this project is to get "hands on code" for a seminar. 

## Description 
This game is just a prototyp. There is still a list of known bugs. 

### Upcoming improvements
* show end of game
* bot setup: random positions for bot's ships 
* bot setup: apply algorithm for shooting
* user setup: make setup easier! (either drag and drop or guide through setup with popups. Any way, user has to be able to see ship positions while setup)
* user setup: list of ships which shows availability/ damages
* use of image for user's ships
* simulate pause between user's shot and bot's shot 

### Known Bugs
* user setup is complicated. If user enters a already occupied position, it can happen that user gets an error all the time -> refresh page
